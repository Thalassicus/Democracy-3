Name = Resume whaling
Description = Whales consume an enormous amount of fish, and may be responsible for a drop in fish catches that affect our economy. Whaling would also provide a welcome boost to our economy. Not every species of whale is endangered, and commercial whaling can go ahead without danger of causing extinction.

Name = Keep ban in place
Description = Whales are generally accepted to be amongst the most intelligent non-human species on earth, they maintain a crucial position in the aquatic food-chain and yet have been hunted close to extinction. Restarting commercial whaling would be incredibly destructive, as well as potentially causing a drop in tourism. We should refocus our efforts on whale watching rather than hunting.
