Name = Pass law
Description = We need this law. In economic terms it makes no sense for people below or above a certain age to be rendered unemployable. Also, in human rights terms, this is much needed compensation for years of discrimination in the workplace against ethnic minorities, women, the elderly and the disabled.

[option1]
Name = Reject law
Description = This is a deeply flawed law. It makes no sense to fight discrimination by using discrimination. It creates two problems, that of the minority members who feel they may not have achieved the position on merit, and the resentment of the potential employee who was denied the job.
