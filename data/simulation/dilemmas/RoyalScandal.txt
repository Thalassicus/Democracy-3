MONARCHY

[option0]
Name = Support the monarch
Description = Nobody expects the government of the day to openly criticize the monarch. It would likely lead to major constitutional 'difficulties' and would be considered deeply unpatriotic. We should issue a statement to the effect that the phrase was taken out of context, was off the record and clearly does not represent the views of the royal family.

[option1]
Name = Criticize the monarch
Description = How can we possibly stand by and let this happen without comment? Nobody expects your government to call for the royal families abolition, but at the very least a strongly worded statement to the effect that such comments are 'unhelpful' and 'out of step with the times' would be appropriate, regardless of what the royalists and patriots may think.
