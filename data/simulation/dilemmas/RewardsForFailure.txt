Name = Restrict bonuses
Description = For too long, the bonus culture amongst CEOs has been left to run out of control. Bonuses are supposed to be a reward for business success, but top bank executives are taking unearned bonuses whilst cutting staff numbers. We need a law that prevents companies from paying a bonus in years where they failed to turn a profit.

Name = Do nothing
Description = It's easy to be critical of people earning large salaries and bonuses, but the fact is we live in a globalized world and top bonuses are needed to attract top talent. This is unnecessary interference by government in the corporate pay structure and will hurt our competitiveness.
