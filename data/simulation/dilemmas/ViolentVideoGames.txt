Description = There is scant hard evidence that shows any real direct link between video games and violence. In fact, there is a possibility they act as a catharsis that even prevents young people being violent. This is a knee jerk response from people looking for a simple solution to violence in society, violence that existed long before the first video game was created.

Name = Censor games
Description = There may be no direct proven link, but you don't have to play many of these games to see how the influence they have on impressionable young people must be having a negative impact on society. Video games are an interactive medium and are likely to have a far more direct effect on impressionable minds that passive entertainment such as books, television or movies. Something needs to be done.
