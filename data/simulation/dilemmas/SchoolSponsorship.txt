Name = Allow sponsorship
Description = It would be crazy to turn down the offer of free educational materials. The government cannot provide the state of the art facilities that these companies are prepared to build in our schools.

Description = Our schools are places for kids to be educated, not to be brainwashed in buying this or that brand of cola. Advertising is everywhere in society and schools are one of the last places we can escape from it. Keep big business out of education!
