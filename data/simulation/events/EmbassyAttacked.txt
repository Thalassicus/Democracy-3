Description = Our Embassy in the middle east country of Niraqh has been attacked by extremists armed with rocket-propelled grenades. 17 Embassy staff, including 6 local interpreters have been killed, and 20 more injured. Television news is implying that it is government cut-backs in defense spending that are to blame for the poor level of security at our Embassies. Naturally, patriotic citizens are outraged.
