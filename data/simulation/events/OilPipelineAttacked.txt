Description = We have just heard that there has been an attack on an oil pipeline in a neighboring country, apparently by a rebel faction, and that oil supplies to our country may be under threat. Other nations look like they will be stockpiling oil as a result, to insulate themselves against the effects of repeat attacks, and as a result, the supply of oil to us has fallen and may take a while to recover.
