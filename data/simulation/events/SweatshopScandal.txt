Description = We might have thought that sweatshops were things found in other, less prosperous countries, but a recent TV documentary has bought the issue of local homegrown sweatshops into the public eye. It seems a number of companies making clothing are literally paying slave wages to a large number of employees, especially those from ethnic minorities. This is not going to go down well with Trade Unionists or the Liberals.
