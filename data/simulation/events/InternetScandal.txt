Description = The down-market newspapers have picked up on a number of 'scandalous websites' including those containing race hatred and instructions on bomb making and other crimes. Some of our more conservative citizens are outraged that the internet is not more effectively policed and censored. It might not be possible for us to completely police the net, but the public perception is that we just aren't doing enough.
